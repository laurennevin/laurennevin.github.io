<h3> Introduction </h3>
	<p>In today’s technological era, it’s hard to find a millennial that hasn’t illegally streamed or pirated some form of entertainment. Whether or not the people streaming are aware of its legality, it is an undeniably popular way to get entertainment. Due to safe harbors the legality of it all can be interpreted in different ways depending on the situation. In this essay I’ll be discussing ISP safe harbor laws, streaming and piracy and how they all intersect. Also, I’ll be suggesting new agreements from a user based perspective. </p>
<h3> What is it? </h3>
<p><abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr> Safe harbor laws are restrictions that specify certain circumstances that are deemed not to violate a rule or law. There are also <i>unsafe</i> harbors that are deemed in violation of a rule or law. Theoretically, the implementation of safe harbors combines vague standards and precise rules which gives judges a clear set of boundaries while also allowing them to decide on the cases in between at their own discretion (Morrison, 2013) </p>

<h3>Streaming and Piracy</h3>
	<p>Streaming is defined as <blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/streaming">
“a method of transmitting or receiving data (especially video and audio material) over a computer network as a steady, continuous flow, allowing playback to proceed while subsequent data is being received” 
</blockquote>(“Streaming”, 2017). Focusing on streaming in relation to videos, it has become 
increasing popular recently. Netflix is a company that has added 4.88 million subscribers in the
 first quarter of 2015 and expects 180 million global subscribers by 2020 
 ("Is Netflix more popular than TV?", 2017). This exemplifies the popularity of streaming. 
 <i>Cord Cutter</i> is a new term used to describe the growing population of people who 
 unsubscribe to expensive television channels in favour of streaming the wanted media over 
 internet through ISP’s such as Amazon, Hulu, iTunes, Netflix, Shoomi and Youtube. In the table
 below, the pros and cons of cord cutting. </p>

				<td>You save money, instead of paying $100 on cable per month you can pay $13.99/ month for Netflix’s premium plan.</td>
				<td>It’s not worth it if you have slow internet and must watch on a blurring screen while it buffers.</td>

	<p>Piracy is defined as <blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/piracy">“the unauthorized use of another's production, invention, or conception especially in infringement of a copyright”
	or “the illicit accessing of broadcast signals”</blockquote>Piracy or illegal streaming eliminates the con of streaming services offering a limited selection. </p>
<h3>Facts About Streaming and Piracy</h3>

	</ul>

<h3>Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act</h3>
	<p><acronym title="Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act">OCILLA</acronym> is a safe harbor of the DMCA, also known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that protects online service providers from unintentional acts of copyright infringement. </p>
	<ol>A list of OCILLA provisions:
		<li>Safe harbor provision for online storage</li>
		<li>Transitory Network Communications </li>
		<li>System caching safe harbor </li>
		<li>Information Location Tools Safe Harbor</li>
		<li>Limitation on Liability of Nonprofit Educational Institutions</li>
		<li>Misrepresentations</li>
		<li>Replacement of removed or disabled material and Limitation on Other Liability</li>
		<li>Identify infringers</li>
		<li>Conditions for Eligibility</li>
		<li>Injunctions</li>
		<li>Definitions </li>
		<li>Other Defenses Available</li>
		<li>Protection of Privacy</LI>
		<LI>Independent Construction of Safe Harbors</li>
	</ol>
<h3>Criticisms</h3>
	<p>The OCILLA, in practice suffers from a few criticisms that stem from the clarity of the safe harbor and the complexity of filing counter-notice procedures. </p>
	<p>Due to the fact that ISP’s are threatened more by the OSILLA, ISP’s can be quick to take down user content by request of the copyright holders even though the content might not actually be in violation of anything (Sanchez, 2017). Approximately 60% of all take downs are somewhat flawed (Urban & Karaganis, 2016). This accompanied by the fact that few users know about filing counter- notices results in disgruntled users. ISP’s are not required to tell users about counter-notices, also ISP's may disregard counter-notices. OCILLA protects an ISP from liability to its customer, if the ISP restores removed content following a counter-notice. However, some ISP’s may disregard the counter-notice, and instead cite its terms of service for protection. For example, YouTube has constantly refused to restore counter-noticed content citing its agreement with third-party music owners (Rights,2017).</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
	<p>In retaliation to the criticisms, I think that the OCILLA needs to be stricter on upholding their agreement to reupload user content if their counter-notice is approved. ISP’s shouldn’t be allowed to avoid reuploading content by citing another agreement, and third-parties shouldn’t be allowed to suggest that the wrongfully taken down content not be reuploaded. </p>
	<p>Personally, from an impoverished, university student perspective, I would appreciate all content being free to view, upload and enjoy. But as a realist, I understand the importance of intellectual property and that it needs to be protected so that the creator is the main beneficiary to the contents success. My suggestion for the OCILLA stems from the fact that the OCILLA clearly favors OSP and ISP’s while not holding them liable for mistakes, also the fact that when it was drafted it doesn’t take into account the growth of today’s networking. It’s unrealistic to want to throw out the safe harbor entirely and start fresh, so I want to suggest adjustments to the existing rules. </p>
	<p>My suggestion would be to re-examine the OSILLA while trying to examine it with the interest of Internet users in mind. One step that could further this would be to convert the OCILLA’s reliance on subjective, good faith standards for takedown or counter notification into a more rigorous requirement. Using the idea that a notice should be formed after an inquiry into the content this would affect the above’s list #1 Safe harbor provision for online storage and #7 Replacement of removed or disabled material and Limitation on Other Liability. The proposed change would do this by providing incentives to copyright holders, OSPs, and subscribers alike to refrain from taking hasty or ill-considered actions under the DMCA. It will remain easier to just take down the content than to investigate the complaints against users. For this reason, immunity from monetary relief provided by the safe harbors for ISP’s and OSP’s should be eliminated and replaced with a presumption of innocence, that an ISP would be given as long as it had no knowledge of the infringing content and acted on the complainant in keeping with the idea of “innocent until proven otherwise.” These might be reinforced by adopting some measures that have been used overseas. The first would be imposing a requirement that any copyright holder seeking takedown of specific content must protect the OSP for any liability it might expose itself to its user complies. This requirement was adopted by one European OSP, and was defended by one supporter as a way to provide greater protection to OSP’s than the OSILLA, in addition to “discouraging bogus or ill-researched claims of infringement.” (Scott,2005) In conclusion, my opinion on the matter calls for a reexamination of the OSILLA that takes into consideration of all the parties it affects, copyright holders, OSP’s and ISP’s, and internet users. </p>
